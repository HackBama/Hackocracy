# CREATING YOUR NONPROFIT BYLAWS

_Your nonprofit&#39;s Bylaws are your organizations internal affairs guidebook. Your Bylaws establish procedures for holding elections, organizing meetings, quorum requirements, membership structure (if needed) and other essential operations of your nonprofit. Your Bylaws will serve as your organizational manual and will help guide you through the orderly operation of your corporation._

_Bylaws are not that difficult to create and there are many &quot;sample Bylaws&quot; you can find on the web. Below is a complete set of Bylaws comprised of excerpts from several established nonprofits. You are free to cut/paste the language as needed or download this example as a word doc using the link at the right._

_Before we start there is one thing to note. Unlike your Articles of Incorporation, the IRS does not require any specific language to be included in your Bylaws. But best practices suggest that you should still include certain reference to your organizations structure and purpose to serve as a reminder about the makeup of your nonprofit._

_Some things to keep in mind as you begin:_

- _There is a big difference between the words &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;may&quot;. It is obvious what the difference is, so choose wisely between the two._
- _It is not necessary to copy these sample Bylaws word for word. Feel free to tweak it to fit the needs and wants of your organization._
- _There are certain things you will need to comply with depending on the laws in your state (number of meetings, minimum number of board members, etc.). Check with your__ _ [_Secretary of State_](http://nonprofitally.com/state-nonprofit-links)_ __to see what laws apply to your nonprofit._

**ARTICLE II. CORPORATE PURPOSE**

**Section 1. Nonprofit Purpose**

_This is the language that is required in your Articles of Incorporation by the IRS. It is not necessary to include this in your Bylaws, but it is a good idea to restate it as a reference._

This corporation is organized exclusively for charitable, religious, educational, and scientific purposes, including, for such purposes, the making of distributions to organizations that qualify as exempt organizations under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or the corresponding section of any future federal tax code.

# **Section 2. Specific Purpose**

_Here you put the purpose of your organization as well as the specific activities you will be involved in. It is a good idea to list the major activities of your nonprofit without being too specific about the details. You want to have a focused scope of work without limiting the ability to grow the organization in the future. The following sample is from_ [Noble Paws, Inc.](http://noblepawsalaska.org/bylaws_noblepaws.pdf) _in Fairbanks Alaska._

# **ARTICLE X. IDEMNIFICATION**

# _According to StartUpLawTalk.com &quot;indemnification&quot; means:_

# _&quot;… a_ _promise by the other party to cover your losses if they do something that causes you harm or causes a third party to sue you.__&quot;_

# _In other words, an indemnity clause is authored to help prevent board members and employees from being sued if someone were to file a lawsuit against your organization. OK. So, maybe that is not exactly how indemnification works. But I know it is important to have this in your Bylaws. And, it is doubly important to purchase liability insurance for your staff and board of directors._
